# UFODataVisualization

UFO Sightings Data Visualization (Python + Selenium)
Overview

The UFO Sightings Data Visualization Project is a Python-based visualization tool that maps reported UFO sightings across the United States using geographic coordinates. The project leverages Selenium to automate browser-based map rendering, allowing sighting locations to be plotted dynamically on a U.S. map for visual analysis.

The goal of this project is to explore spatial patterns in real-world, user-reported UFO sighting data through geographic visualization.

Key Features

**U.S. Map Visualization**
Plots UFO sightings directly on a map of the United States using latitude and longitude coordinates.

**Coordinate-Based Plotting**
Uses precise geographic coordinates to accurately represent sighting locations.

**Browser Automation with Selenium**
Selenium is used to programmatically control the browser and render the visualization.

**Exploratory Spatial Analysis**
Enables visual inspection of regional clustering, density, and distribution of sightings.

**Tech Stack**

Python

Selenium

Web-based map rendering (via automated browser control)

CSV / structured data input

Dataset

The dataset consists of reported UFO sightings within the United States, including:

Latitude and longitude

Location (city/state)

Date of sighting

Additional descriptive attributes (if available)

Note: Sightings are self-reported and may vary in accuracy. The visualization is intended for exploratory and educational purposes.

Project Goals

Visualize spatial patterns in UFO sightings across the U.S.

Practice working with geographic coordinate data

Apply Selenium beyond testing, using it for visualization automation

Improve understanding of spatial data representation
